This Project is an attempt to build a customer load balancer from first principles. 

It will be refined as we go along. 

USAGE

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python3 console.py (To configure the Load Balancer and run it)
3. python3 Server1.py (to run a custom built HTTP server. Do same for Server2. you can clone more servers. check the client_servers folder)
4. python3 get_reqs.py <Load int value> (to generate multiple get requests)

N/B: Make sure to check the ports for the servers specific to your own computer
