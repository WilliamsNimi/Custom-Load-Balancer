This Project is an attempt to build a customer load balancer from first principles. 

It will be refined as we go along. 

USAGE

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. sudo python3 LoadBalancer.py (We are using sudo because this server is running on port 80)
3. Python3 Server1.py (to run a custom built HTTP server. Do same for Server2. you can clone more servers)
4. Python3 get_reqs.py (to generate multiple get requests)

N/B: Make sure to check the ports for the servers specific to your own computer
